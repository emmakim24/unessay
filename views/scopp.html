                Launched in 1964 at Carnegie Institute of Technology, SCOPP was a pioneering program aimed at helping overlooked but capable students from disadvantaged backgrounds prepare for college. This page explores how SCOPP worked, who it served, and why it mattered.

              <h3>The SCOPP Experience</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                    The 1964 summer session ran from June 15 to July 31, a 6-week summer session, at the Carnegie Institute of Technology campus.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Courses in Biology, Algebra, and English
                </li>
                <li>
                    Students lived at home except for the final week, when they stayed in a campus dormitory.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The program was multi-year: as 11th graders, students would attend Saturday classes; the following summer, they would live on campus and participate in a new academic program; as 12th graders, Saturday classes would continue.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Financial support for college was being raised by the local NEED organization.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>Classes were co-taught by public school and college instructors, with counseling and cultural outings included in the curriculum.</p>

            <!-- Participants -->
            <section class="scopp-participants">
              <h3>Who Participated?</h3>
              <p>The 1964 SCOPP cohort included 43 students from 11 high schools, primarily Black students, selected through nominations, interviews, and academic indicators of untapped potential.</p>
              <img src="static/scopp-students.jpeg" alt="SCOPP group photo">
              <p><strong>William Green</strong>, SCOPP counselor, noted how the program redefined student potential: “All that teacher sees is the same old knucklehead… even when the student himself changed.”</p>

            <!-- Historical Context -->
            <section class="scopp-historical">
                <h3>Why SCOPP Was Needed</h3>
                <p>In the early 1960s, racial and economic barriers excluded many capable students from higher education. SCOPP responded by targeting “latent-talent” youth who were often overlooked in public schools, aligning with the goals of the Civil Rights Movement.</p>
                <blockquote class="scopp-quote">
                    “Motivation was more important than prior achievement.” – SCOPP report, 1964

            <!-- Language Reflection -->
            <section class="scopp-language">
                <h3>Reframing the Language</h3>
                <p>Early documents described SCOPP students as “underachievers” or “disadvantaged.” Today, we recognize how these terms reflected deficit-based thinking. SCOPP, however, treated students as assets with promise, not problems to be fixed.</p>

              <h3>SCOPP's Lasting Impact</h3>
              <p>33 of 36 SCOPP students were accepted into college. The program gained national attention and directly inspired the launch of Upward Bound, the first of the federal TRIO programs.</p>

                <p>SCOPP was not just a summer school—it was a statement of belief in the potential of every student. Its legacy lives on through the TRIO programs and ongoing fights for educational equity in America.</p>
