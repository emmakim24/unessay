                    <h3>Introduction</h3>
                    <p id="ub-intro">
                        Launched in the summer of 1964, the School-College Orientation Program of Pittsburgh (SCOPP)  was one of the first programs to take immediate action after the Civil Rights Act, and aimed to expand access to higher education for high school students who had been historically overlooked due to race, income, or social status. A collaborative partnership between the Pittsburgh Public Schools and Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University), resulted in SCOPP which challenged the perceived perceptions of who is deserving of college acceptance. SCOPP targeted “latent-talent” students- those who have the intellectual potential but often challenged with systemic barrier, leading to a “un-achieving” or “unmotivated” label. By offering an opportunity for academic instruction, counseling, social/cultural enrichment and even a residential college experience, SCOPP helped redefine academic potential, as an idea of opportunity rather than background. This page is dedicated to SCOPP content, exploring how it operated, who was involved, its significance and more!

              <h3>The SCOPP Experience</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                    The 1964 summer session ran from June 15 to July 31, a 6-week summer session, at the Carnegie Institute of Technology campus.

                <li>
                    Courses in Biology, Algebra, and English
                </li>
                <li>
                    Students lived at home except for the final week, when they stayed in a campus dormitory.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The program was multi-year: as 11th graders, students would attend Saturday classes; the following summer, they would live on campus and participate in a new academic program; as 12th graders, Saturday classes would continue.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Financial support for college was being raised by the local NEED organization.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>Classes were co-taught by public school and college instructors, with counseling and cultural outings included in the curriculum.</p>

            <!-- Participants -->
            <section class="ub-participants">
              <h3>Who Participated?</h3>
              <p>The 1964 SCOPP cohort included 43 students from 11 high schools, primarily Black students, selected through nominations, interviews, and academic indicators of untapped potential.</p>
              <img src="static/scopp-students.jpeg" alt="SCOPP group photo">
              <p><strong>William Green</strong>, SCOPP counselor, noted how the program redefined student potential: “All that teacher sees is the same old knucklehead… even when the student himself changed.”</p>

            <!-- Historical Context -->
            <section class="ub-historical">
                <h3>Why SCOPP Was Needed</h3>
                <p>In the early 1960s, racial and economic barriers excluded many capable students from higher education. SCOPP responded by targeting “latent-talent” youth who were often overlooked in public schools, aligning with the goals of the Civil Rights Movement.</p>

                    “Motivation was more important than prior achievement.” – SCOPP report, 1964

            <!-- Language Reflection -->
            <section class="ub-language">
                <h3>Reframing the Language</h3>
                <p>Early documents described SCOPP students as “underachievers” or “disadvantaged.” Today, we recognize how these terms reflected deficit-based thinking. SCOPP, however, treated students as assets with promise, not problems to be fixed.</p>

              <h3>SCOPP's Lasting Impact</h3>
              <p>33 of 36 SCOPP students were accepted into college. The program gained national attention and directly inspired the launch of Upward Bound, the first of the federal TRIO programs.</p>

                <p>SCOPP was not just a summer school—it was a statement of belief in the potential of every student. Its legacy lives on through the TRIO programs and ongoing fights for educational equity in America.</p>
