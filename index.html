            <p id="home-intro">
              For my unessay project I decided to use the skills I have learned in my other classes to build a website on the content this course has taught me. I have selected SCOPP and Upward Bound to focus on, as we have spent a significant amount of time on the topics, and they 
              have deeply intrigued me as a student. This website explores both SCOPP (School-College Orientation Program of Pittsburgh) and Upward Bound-- programs created during the Civil Rights Movement to support underrepresented, under-resourced students in achieving higher education.

              <h3>Key Topics Covered</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  SCOPP:
                  The School-College Orientation Program of Pittsburgh (S.C.O.P.P.) was a pioneering initiative launched in 1964. Designed for underachieving but intellectually capable high school students from disadvantaged areas of Pittsburgh, SCOPP aimed to build both academic skills and personal motivation for college. Students took summer classes in Biology, Mathematics, and English at Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon), participated in cultural and recreational activities, and received targeted counseling. With a high staff-to-student ratio and integrated instruction from both high school and college educators, SCOPP worked to increase college attendance by fostering confidence, engagement, and academic preparedness.

                <li>
                  Upward Bound:
                  A federally funded program created in 1965, Upward Bound was inspired in part by local programs like SCOPP. It supports high school students from low-income families and those whose parents did not attend college. The program offers year-round academic instruction, tutoring, mentoring, college prep, cultural enrichment, and financial aid guidance. Its goal is to ensure participants graduate high school, enter postsecondary education, and earn a degree. Upward Bound remains a cornerstone of the federal TRIO programs and has served hundreds of thousands of students across the U.S.

                <li>
                  Educational Equity:
                  Educational equity means ensuring that every student receives the specific resources, support, and opportunities needed to reach their full academic and personal potential—regardless of race, income, language, ability, or background. Unlike equality, which treats all students the same, equity acknowledges systemic barriers and strives to remove them through individualized support. Its ultimate goal is to ensure that student success is no longer predictable by social or cultural factors, and that all learners feel valued, empowered, and represented in their education.

              <h3> What You’ll Learn</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>How SCOPP operated and who it served</li>
                <li>How Upward Bound scaled those ideas nationally</li>
                <li>What impact these programs had—then and now</li>
                <li>Why access to higher education remains a key challenge today</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                SCOPP helped spark the TRIO era—a series of federal initiatives, beginning with Upward Bound in 1965, that aimed to break down barriers to higher education for low-income, first-generation, and underrepresented students. Today, TRIO programs serve hundreds of thousands of students annually.
